* Rename class to "Introduction to Programming for Data Science". 
* Limit enrollment to 40.
* Use LC classrooms with flexible arrangements, not amphitheaters

* Create new instance with only Python 3.

* Math expressions together with numeric variables
* if statements (and nested blocks of code) together with boolean variables
* Add while loops before discussing for loops. Allows easier discussion of break/continue compared to for. (Perhaps even before complex data structures, as it is connected with if-else?)
* More exercises in loops
