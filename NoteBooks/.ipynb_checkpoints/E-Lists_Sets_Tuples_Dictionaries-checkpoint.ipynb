    "We have covered in detail much of the basics of python's primitive data types. Its now useful to consider how these basic types can be collected in ways that are meaningful and useful for a variety of tasks. Data structures are a fundamental component of programming, a collection of elements of data that adhere to certain properties, depending on the type. In these notes, we'll present three basic data structures, the list, the set, and the dictionary. Python data structures are very rich, and beyond the scope of this simple primer. Please see [the documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html) for a more complete view.\n"

    "\n",
    "A list, sometimes called and array or a vector is an ordered collection of values. The value of a particular element in a list is retrieved by querying for a specific index into an array. Lists allow duplicate values, but but indicies are unique. In python, like most programming languages, list indices start at 0, that is, to get the first element in a list, request the element at index 0. Lists provide very fast access to elements at specific positions, but are inefficient at \"membership queries,\" determining if an element is in the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, lists are specified by square brackets, `[ ]`, containing zero or more values, separated by commas. Lists are the most common data structure, and are often generated as a result of other functions, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "`a_string.split(\" \")`\n",

    "will take a string, split it on space, and then return a list of the smaller substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To query a specific value from a list, pass in the requested index into square brackets following the name of the list. Negative indices can be used to traverse the list from the right. (Remember the case with strings and accessing the individual characters? It is exactly the same. In fact, strings are treated in Python as lists of characters.)"

    "washington_post = \"\"\"MOSCOW — Russian officials vehemently defended the country’s airstrikes in Syria on Thursday as blows to Islamic State militants even as evidence mounted suggesting that U.S.-backed rebels and others were facing the brunt of Moscow’s attacks.\n",
    "And while Russian officials and diplomats rallied behind President Vladi­mir Putin, the Kremlin’s stance appeared further clouded by acknowledgments that the missions have already extended beyond solely the Islamic State.\n",
    "In Paris, the Russian ambassador to France, Alexander Orlov, said the Russian attacks also targeted an al-Qaeda-linked group, Jabhat al-Nusra, or al-Nusra Front.\n",
    "Syria’s ambassador to Russia, Riad Haddad, echoed that the joint hit list for Russia and the Syrian government included Jabhat al-Nusra, which is believed to have some coordination with the Islamic State but is still seen mostly as a rival.\n",
    "“We are confronting armed terrorist groups in Syria, regardless of how they identify themselves, whether it is Jabhat al-Nusra, the ISIL or others,” he said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.\n",
    "Graphic Did the Russians really strike the Islamic State? VIEW GRAPHIC \n",
    "“They all are pursuing ISIL ends,” he added, according to the Interfax news agency.\n",
    "The ambassadors did not specifically mention any U.S.- and Western-backed rebel groups.\n",
    "But the comment was certain to deepen suspicions by Washington and allies that Putin’s short-term aim is to give more breathing space to Syria’s embattled President Bashar al-Assad, whose government is strongly supported by Moscow.\n",
    "Syrian activists, meanwhile, ramped up their own claims that Moscow was hitting groups seeking to bring down Assad, who has managed to hang on during more than four years of civil war.\n",
    "Russia’s expanding military intervention in Syria added urgency to separate efforts by Russia and U.S. officials to coordinate strategies against the Islamic State and avoid potential airspace missteps between the two powers — so-called “deconfliction” talks. The Pentagon said the discussions will begin Thursday.\n",
    "One monitoring group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Russian airstrikes again struck strongholds of an American-backed rebel group, Tajamu Alezzah, in central Hama province.\n",
    "The actions, quickly criticized by Washington, add an unpredictable element to a multilayered war.\n",
    "The observatory also reported that airstrikes hit the northwestern city Jisr al-Shughour, which is in the hands of rebel groups including al-Nusra, after battles last month to drive back Assad’s forces.\n",
    "Among the locations hit was a site near Kafr Nabl, the northern Syrian town whose weekly protests against the government, often featuring pithy slogans in English, won it renown as a symbol of what began as a peaceful protest movement against the Assad regime. The local council receives U.S. assistance, and the rebel unit there has received support under a covert CIA program aimed at bolstering moderate rebels.\n",
    "Raed Fares, one of the leaders of the protest movement in Kafr Nabl, said warplanes struck a Free Syrian Army checkpoint guarding Roman ruins on the outskirts of the town. He said the explosion was bigger than anything local residents had seen in three years of airstrikes conducted by Syrian warplanes.\n",
    "“It made a fire six kilometers wide,” he told The Washington Post.\n",
    "Other sites hit on the second day of Russian bombing included locations in the province of Hama. The targets suggested the main intention of the strikes was to shore up government control over a corridor of territory linking the capital, Damascus, to the Assad family’s coastal heartland, where the Russians are operating out of an expanded air base.\n",
    "Syrian rebels, some of them U.S.-backed, had been making slow but steady gains in the area, considered one of the government’s biggest vulnerabilities. There has been no Islamic State presence there since January 2014, when moderate rebels rose up against the extremists and forced them to retreat to eastern Syria.\n",
    "In Washington, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told CNN he could “absolutely confirm” that airstrikes hit Western-backed groups such as the Free Syrian Army and other factions “armed and trained by the CIA.”\n",
    "“We have communications with people there,” said McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n",
    "The accounts could not be independently assessed, but the main focus of the Russian attacks appeared to be in areas not known to have strong Islamic State footholds.\n",
    "In Moscow, the reply was blunt.\n",
    "“Total rubbish,” Gennady Zyuganov, a member of parliament and leader of Russia’s Communist Party, said of the U.S. accusations.\n",
    "In televised remarks Thursday, Putin called accusations that Russian airstrikes had killed civilians in Syria “information attacks.”\n",
    "He also addressed concerns about an accidental military clash between Russian and U.S.-led coalition forces, saying that his intelligence and military agencies were “establishing contacts” with counterparts in the United States.\n",
    "“This work is ongoing, and I hope that it will conclude with the creation of a regularly acting mechanism,” he said.\n",
    "A spokesman for Russia’s Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov, said Thursday that warplanes hit a dozen Islamic State sites in the past 24 hours, destroying targets including a command center and two arms depots.\n",
    "The United States and Russia agree on the need to fight the Islamic State but not about what to do with the Syrian president. The Syrian civil war, which grew out of an uprising against Assad, has killed more than 250,000 people since March 2011 and sent millions of refugees fleeing to countries in the Middle East and Europe.\n",
    "Accusing Russia of “pouring gasoline on the fire,” Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter vowed that U.S. pilots would continue their year-long bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, despite Moscow’s warning that American planes should stay away from its operations.\n",
    "“I think what they’re doing is going to backfire and is counterproductive,” Carter said on Wednesday.\n",
    "Yet Russia’s military flexing in Syria brought quick overtures from neighboring Iraq, where the Islamic State also holds significant territory but the government is within Washington’s fold.\n",
    "Iraq’s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, told France 24 that he “would welcome” Russia joining the U.S.-led airstrikes against Islamic State targets, but there have been no specific discussions.\n",
    "Joining the protests against the Russian airstrikes was Saudi Arabia, a leading foe of Assad and one of Washington’s top Middle East allies.\n",
    "At the United Nations late Wednesday, the Saudi ambassador, Abdallah al-Mouallimi, demanded that the Russian air campaign “stop immediately” and accused Moscow of carrying out attacks in areas outside the control of the Islamic State.\n",
    "In Iran, Assad’s main regional backer, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham called Russia’s military role a step “toward resolving the current crisis” in Syria.\n",
    "Sly reported from Beirut, and Murphy from Washington. Daniela Deane in London, William Branigin in Washington and Loveday Morris in Baghdad contributed to this report.\n",

    "Yahoo Inc. disclosed a massive security breach by a “state-sponsored actor” affecting at least 500 million users, potentially the largest such data breach on record and the latest hurdle for the beaten-down internet company as it works through the sale of its core business.\n",
    "Yahoo said certain user account information—including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers—was stolen from the company’s network in late 2014 by what it believes is a state-sponsored actor.\n",
    "Yahoo said it is notifying potentially affected users and has taken steps to secure their accounts by invalidating unencrypted security questions and answers so they can’t be used to access an account and asking potentially affected users to change their passwords.\n",
    "Yahoo recommended users who haven’t changed their passwords since 2014 do so. It also encouraged users change their passwords as well as security questions and answers for any other accounts on which they use the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account.\n",
    "The company, which is working with law enforcement, said the continuing investigation indicates that stolen information didn't include unprotected passwords, payment-card data or bank account information.\n",
    "With 500 million user accounts affected, this is the largest-ever publicly disclosed data breach, according to Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearing House, a not-for-profit group that compiles information on data breaches.\n",
    "No evidence has been found to suggest the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo’s network, and Yahoo didn’t name the country it suspected was involved. In August, a hacker called “Peace” appeared in online forums, offering to sell 200 million of the company’s usernames and passwords for about $1,900 in total. Peace had previously sold data taken from breaches at Myspace and LinkedIn Corp.\n",

    "SAN FRANCISCO — Information from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen from the company in 2014, and the  company said Thursday it believes that a state-sponsored actor was behind the hack.\n",
    "The information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, Yahoo said.\n",
    "Claims surfaced in early August that a hacker using the name \"Peace\" was trying to sell the usernames, passwords and dates of birth of Yahoo account users on the dark web — a black market of thousands of secret websites.\n",
    "The FBI said it was aware of the matter. The compromise of public and private sector systems is something the agency takes very seriously and it said it will continue to investigate and hold accountable all who pose a threat in cyberspace, the agency said in an emailed statement.\n",
    "Yahoo recommends that users who haven’t changed their passwords since 2014 do so. The company said it was notifying potentially affected users and taking steps to secure their accounts. That included invalidating unencrypted security questions and answers and asking users to change their passwords.\n",
    "The announcement comes as Yahoo looks to complete its $4.8. billion sale of its core Internet business to media giant Verizon Communications, which said it was notified of the Yahoo breach \"within the last two days.\"\n",
    "\"We understand that Yahoo is conducting an active investigation of this matter, but we otherwise have limited information and understanding of the impact,\" Verizon said.\n",
    "Given the unsettled nature of Yahoo's ownership just now, “regulators should be concerned with who will take responsibility for the response to this compromise. It can be easy for the ‘right thing to do’ to slip through the cracks in a multi-billion dollar transition,\" said Tim Erlin, senior director of IT security and risk strategy at Tripwire, a computer security firm.\n",
